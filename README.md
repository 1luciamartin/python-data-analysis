# Old Faithful Regression (Python)
This is a small data analysis project where I look at the relationship between
eruption duration and waiting time in the Old Faithful geyser dataset. The goal
is to see whether a linear model is reasonable and how well it describes the
pattern we see in the data. (This project was created for learning and practice purposes.)

## What I did
In this notebook I:
- loaded the dataset and renamed the columns to make them easier to work with
- plotted duration vs waiting time to see the overall trend
- converted the variables to standard units and computed the correlation
- calculated the regression slope and intercept in the original units
- made a couple of example predictions using the regression line
- plotted residuals and ran some basic regression diagnostics
- wrote a short conclusion based on the graphs and model behavior

## Tools used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, and SciPy.

## How to run the notebook
You can open the notebook (`old_faithful_regression.ipynb` file) in either Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run the cells from top to bottom.
