#Old Faithful Eruptions: Linear Regression Mini Project

In this mini project, I look at the relationship between eruption duration and the waiting time until the next eruption.
I use plots, correlation, and a simple regression line to make a couple predictions and check residuals.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings

warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
##1) Load the data
I’m using the Old Faithful dataset with two columns:
- `duration` = eruption duration (minutes)
- `wait` = waiting time until the next eruption (minutes)
